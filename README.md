# E-yantra robotics competition 2024-25
### This repo consists of the entire timeline and all the source codes related to the competition.
### We participated in an International Level competition conducted by IIT Bombay, E-yantra Robotics Competition, We chose to participate in the **Balancing Builder Bot** theme. 
## Team members:
* ### Prasidh V (Me) 
* ### [Pranav PKV](https://github.com/pranav-co)
* ### [Samarth SS](https://github.com/samarthsugur)
* ### [Sriram CS](https://github.com/sriramcs24)
## The timeline:
* # Stage 1
* ### Task 0: Software installation and testing   <br>  --> We installed CoppeliaSim and tested basic code given by eyrc. <br> --> We attended a basic quiz related to our theme.
* ### Task1: <br> This task is divided into 3 sub tasks: <br>   <br> --> Task1A: Math modelling using python  <br>  In this task, We learnt how to solve a system of given non-linear equations to find the below parameters using python: <br> <br> -> Equilibrium points <br>  -> Jacobian Matrices <br> -> Eigen values <br> -> Stability <br> -> LQR gain matrix <br>    <br>  --> Task1B: Balancing of the bot <br>  Here we learnt to write a programme in python to balance the bot, we had to balance it in the upright positon, we learnt how a PID controller works and we had to implement it, It was a pretty difficult task at the beginning as we didn't know anything PID controller, it was quite difficult tuning the bot, but we could finally get it working. <br>  <br>  --> Task1C: Yaw Control & Path Traversal  <br> Here we learnt to programme the bot to move forward & backward and turn left & right, it's a pretty simple task.
* ### Task2: <br> This task is divided into 2 sub tasks:  <br>   <br>  --> Task2A: Balancing bot with manipulator for pick and place <br>  We programmed the claw to move up & down, open & close. It was quite a difficult task, In in this task we just picked up the box from one place and dropped it in another place. <br> Check out the video:

  * ### --> Task2B: Perfection of control by traversing in track <br>  Here we perfected to traverse the bot with the claw in path, here we picked up the box from middle of the path and drop it in the finishing line. <br> Check out the video:  <br>

* # Stage 2 
## Our team got selected for stage 2 for that we had to come under top 50 which was pretty difficult as there were many teams.
* ### Task3: <br> This task is divided into 3 sub tasks: <br>  <br> --> Task3A: Arena preparation <br>  <br> --> Task3B: Bot and it's manipulator building <br> We designed the entire robot with the claw in fusion 360 and we got the robot 3D printed <br>  <br>  --> Task3C: Balancing of the bot <br>  Here we faced the real challenge while programming the bot as it was quite different to programme it in the simulator and the real world, it took us a lot of time to finish this task and we had to switch from python to C programe to code the entire bot as it was in arduino, we did complete the task. <br> check out the video: <br>

* ### Task4: <br> This task is divided into 2 sub tasks: <br>  <br> --> Task4A: traversing of the bot <br> Here we programmed the bot to move forward & backward and turn left & right. <br> Check out the video: <br>

## For the rest of the tasks we could not complete due to our exams as it clashed at the exact same time, as everything was hardware tasks we had to be present all the time while doing the task 
## All the source code for the above tasks are available in this repository you can refer to it.
